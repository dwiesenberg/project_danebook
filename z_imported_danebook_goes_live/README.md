Danebook Comes Aliiiiiiive
===================
Welcome to the world of deployment. You can never go back!

- This taught you the fun of custom routes. Nothing in Rails is set in stone; it's just highly opinionated. The 7 RESTful Routes of Rails are just a default convention useful for CRUD.
- Headers were a great bonus partial if you got bored of changing all those `<img>` tags into `<%= image_tag ... %>`
- When wiring up buttons, remember you can send them where you want for now using `action = "<%= path_helper %>" ` and avoid hard-coding. Soon enough, you'll know enough about Rails' automagical form features to avoid this kind of thing.
- this assignment is deployed [at this address](http://viking-danebook.herokuapp.com/)
- deployment on Heroku
    + remember to use the 'rails_12factor' gem! If you don't, you'll wonder why Bootstrap and images don't work.
